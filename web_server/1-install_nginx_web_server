# Install nginx, configure it to listen on port 80, and serve a page containing "Holberton School"

# Update package list and install nginx with -y to auto-confirm
apt-get update -y
apt-get install -y nginx

# Create a custom index.html file with the required content

# Ensure nginx listens on port 80 (default behavior, but just to be sure)
# The default config listens on port 80, so no need to change anything unless modified

# Restart nginx without systemctl: use service command instead
service nginx restart
